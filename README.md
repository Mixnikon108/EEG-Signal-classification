## Project Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for the data science project developed as part of the course at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. The main objective of the project is to perform the classification of motor imagery EEG signals in patients with high uncertainty using a Spectral Transformer.

## Repository Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file that contains the complete project explained step by step.
- `utils.py`: File with utility functions required for the notebook.
- `models.py`: Implementation of ATCNet and Spectral Transformer.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (make sure you have the required libraries).
2. Open and run the `notebook.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.
